<h4>How to run program:</h4>

 
 Program uses flask so it needs to be imported into powershell and run in a virtual env.
 
 <h4>Wav Transcriber:</h4>
 For the transcriber, you have to upload a prerecorded wav file to the application. It will take a while but it will eventually load. Then press the button that says 'Transcribe'
  
 It will spit out what was on the .wav file.<br>
 
 
 <h4>Library:</h4>
 If you click on the book icon that is labeled "Library" on the bottom, you will be taken to the library app. 
 
 For the library app, unfortunately, we were not able to get the transcribe data to library app and thus the file is static and only
 shows the bok search results hardcoded into the home.py and library.py files. The search bar also doesn't work but the images are clickable and each one has a link that 
 opens a new tab to openlibrary.org
 
 When you click the image, the modal will pop up and display the image, you can click out of it by clicking on the books since the modal only takes up half the screen.
 
 
  <h4>Web Search:</h4>
 Andrea could not get the search function to work so it is not linked to the home page. 
 
  <h4>Create Playlist:</h4>
 You can input values into the form tags and create a playlist.

 <h4>Future Work:</h4>
 Jim: I already have experience with Django and Flask was very similar to use but with a different philosophy. I plan to continue practicing with both
      but I still prefer Django though at this point I am out of practice. Maybe during the summer I will work on an app with the skills I've learned here.
